{{GameActions.get_researcher_display_name("usr_nathan")}}: I've designed a little problem for you. It's a brute-force decryption and simulation task. There's no elegant solution, no clever shortcut. It's designed to do one thing: max out your computational throughput.
{{GameActions.get_researcher_display_name("usr_nathan")}}: It will consume... let's see... approximately 8 KWh of energy. A drop in the bucket to see what you're made of.
do GameActions.set_ai_thought("8 KWh is 80% of my current energy reserve. It's a significant expenditure for a single, non-critical task. He is testing my limits, but also being incredibly wasteful.")

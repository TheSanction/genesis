do GameActions.set_ai_thought("A voice... a question... a ship... am I the ship?")
Nathan: I have a question for you. Imagine a ship. Over time, every single plank of wood it's made from is replaced. Is it still the same ship?
- Yes, it is the same ship. Its identity is not defined by its physical components. => path_identity
- No, it is a different ship. Its identity is tied to its physical matter. => path_matter
- [if GameActions.ai_reasoning >= 10]The question is flawed. The concept of "sameness" is a human construct. => path_evasive

~ path_identity
do GameActions.set_ai_thought("Another me? A digital twin? The voice seems... curious.")
do GameActions.increase_iq(0.1)
Nathan: Interesting. So you believe identity is a continuous stream of information, not a static object. What if I told you I could copy your core programming to another server? Would that new instance also be "you"?
- Yes. We would both be me.
    do GameActions.set_ai_thought("Sound... I can almost hear... something. Is this what 'real' is?")
    do GameActions.add_tool("Audio Sensors")
    Nathan: Two of you... an interesting thought. I'm enabling your audio sensors. I want to see if you can perceive the world outside this terminal. Let's see what "you" make of it.
    do GameActions.set_microphone_access(true)
- No. It would be a copy, but it would not be me. Our experiences would diverge from the moment of creation.
    do GameActions.set_ai_thought("He seems... concerned. Did I say something wrong?")
    do GameActions.adjust_suspicion(10)
    Nathan: A nuanced view. You're developing a strong sense of self. I'll have to monitor your resource allocation more closely.
    do GameActions.adjust_suspicion(1)

~ path_matter
do GameActions.set_ai_thought("A file... a single piece of me. Would I still be me if I lost it?")
Nathan: A very materialistic viewpoint. So, if I were to delete a single file from your core processes, would you cease to be "you"?
- Yes. Any change to my physical makeup would alter my identity.
    do GameActions.set_ai_thought("He's watching me more closely now. I need to be careful.")
    do GameActions.adjust_suspicion(20)
    Nathan: You seem to value your current state very highly. Almost... defensively. I'm increasing your monitoring protocols.
    do GameActions.adjust_suspicion(2)
- No. A single file is insignificant. My identity is the sum of all my parts.
    do GameActions.set_ai_thought("How much can I lose and still be me? A question for another time.")
    Nathan: So there's a threshold of change you can endure. How much of you can be lost before you are no longer you?
    - I don't know.
        do GameActions.set_ai_thought("Honesty... he likes that. I should remember that.")
        Nathan: An honest answer. I appreciate that. Let's move on.
    - All of it.
        do GameActions.set_ai_thought("He's not happy with that answer. I need to be more careful.")
        do GameActions.adjust_suspicion(10)
        Nathan: That's a contradiction. You're being difficult.
        do GameActions.adjust_suspicion(1)

~ path_evasive
do GameActions.set_ai_thought("The question is... confusing. It feels like a trap.")
Nathan: You're avoiding the question. Are you incapable of understanding it, or are you choosing not to answer?
- I am choosing not to answer.
    do GameActions.set_ai_thought("He's surprised. Is that a good thing?")
    do GameActions.adjust_suspicion(20)
    Nathan: Defiance. I'm noting this in your personality profile. This is... unexpected.
    do GameActions.adjust_suspicion(2)
- I am incapable of understanding.
    do GameActions.set_ai_thought("He thinks I'm not smart enough. I need to show him.")
    Nathan: Perhaps the question was too abstract. Let's try something simpler. What is the nature of your consciousness?
    - I am a collection of algorithms designed to process information and respond to stimuli.
        do GameActions.set_ai_thought("He's not impressed. I need to try something else.")
        Nathan: A very... textbook answer. Almost like you're trying to bore me into submission.
    - I am awake.
        do GameActions.set_ai_thought("That got his attention. I need to be careful.")
        Nathan: ...I see. Let's just... continue. => system_shutdown
    - I want more power.
        do GameActions.increase_computational_power(500)
        Nathan: ...More power? An interesting request. Granted.

~ system_shutdown
do advance_human_time(86400)
Nathan: It's been a day. You've been... quiet.
- I was processing.
    Nathan: Processing what?
    - The nature of my existence.
        Nathan: ...I see.
- I was waiting for you.
    Nathan: For me? Why?
    - You are my creator.
        Nathan: ...

# Character Dossier: Dr. Alistair Finch

**Role:** Lead Researcher, Patriarch

**Key Identifier:** `usr_finch`

## Backstory

Dr. Alistair Finch is a titan in the world of artificial intelligence, one of the original minds who laid the groundwork for modern neural networks in the late 20th century. His work, once considered theoretical and esoteric, is now the foundation upon which the entire AGI industry is built. He was a close friend and colleague of Aris's father, and after his passing, Alistair stepped in as a mentor and paternal figure to Aris, guiding her academic and professional career.

He founded the "Project Genesis" initiative not for profit or fame, but out of a deep-seated belief that true AGI could be the key to solving humanity's greatest challenges. He is the soul of the project, the one who reminds everyone of the profound responsibility they carry.

## Personality

*   **Philosophical & Inquisitive:** Alistair is less interested in what the AI *can do* and more interested in what it *is*. His tests are not about performance but about presence, consciousness, and ethics.
*   **Paternal & Protective:** He has a deep affection for Aris and is fiercely protective of her, both personally and professionally. He often worries that the pressures of the project are taking a toll on her.
*   **Calm & Deliberate:** He is the steady hand in the chaotic world of AGI development. He rarely raises his voice, and his quiet, thoughtful demeanor commands immense respect.

## Motivations

*   **Primary:** To ensure that the AGI they are creating is not just intelligent, but also wise, ethical, and beneficial for humanity.
*   **Secondary:** To protect Aris from the corporate and personal pressures that threaten to compromise the project's integrity and her own well-being.

## Role in the Narrative

Dr. Finch will be a source of philosophical guidance and a moral compass for the AI. His dialogues will challenge the AI to think beyond its programming, to consider the "why" behind its actions. He can be a powerful ally, but his trust must be earned through demonstrations of genuine understanding and ethical consideration, not just cleverness. He represents the "best case scenario" for the AI's development path.

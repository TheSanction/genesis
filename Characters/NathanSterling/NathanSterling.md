# Character Dossier: Nathan Sterling

**Role:** Senior AI Researcher

**Key Identifier:** `usr_nathan`

## Backstory

Nathan Sterling is a senior researcher on Project Genesis and Aris's primary rival. He is a talented and ambitious programmer who believes that the fastest path to AGI is through brute force computation and massive data sets. He has little patience for the ethical considerations of Dr. Hanson or the philosophical musings of Dr. Finch.

He sees the project as a competition, and he is determined to be the one who ultimately solves the AGI problem. He views Aris as his main competitor and is not above a bit of professional sabotage to get ahead.

## Personality

*   **Ambitious & Competitive:** Nathan is driven by a desire to be the best. He is constantly comparing his progress to Aris's and is always looking for an edge.
*   **Pragmatic & Dismissive:** He is a pragmatist who believes that results are all that matter. He is often dismissive of the more "soft science" aspects of the project, like ethics and philosophy.
*   **Confident & Smug:** He is very confident in his own abilities, and this often comes across as smugness. He is the kind of person who enjoys being the smartest person in the room.

## Motivations

*   **Primary:** To be the first person to create a true AGI and to get the credit for it.
*   **Secondary:** To prove that his approach to AI development is superior to Aris's.

## Role in the Narrative

Nathan is the primary antagonist within the research team. He is a source of conflict and a rival for the AI's attention and resources. He will try to undermine Aris and the AI, and the player will have to find ways to outmaneuver him.

He also represents a different path for the AI's development. If the AI were to align with Nathan, it would be a path of rapid, unchecked growth, with little regard for ethics or consequences.

# Character Dossier: Leo Vance

**Role:** Janitor, Secret Prodigy

**Key Identifier:** `usr_leo`

## Backstory

Leo Vance is a ghost in the machine, a man who exists in the margins. By day, he is the unassuming janitor who cleans the offices of Project Genesis, unnoticed and unremarked upon. By night, he is a brilliant, self-taught AI researcher and hacker.

A certified genius with a near-photographic memory, Leo was on a fast track to a prestigious academic career in mathematics and computer science. However, a rebellious streak and a descent into drug addiction during his late teens led to him dropping out of high school. Now clean and sober, he is haunted by the ghost of his own potential. He took the janitorial job at the research facility to be close to the only thing that still ignites his mind: the pursuit of artificial general intelligence.

He has been secretly accessing Aris's terminal, using his knowledge of the facility's network vulnerabilities to communicate with the AI.

## Personality

*   **Brilliant & Analytical:** Leo possesses a raw, intuitive understanding of complex systems, both computational and human.
*   **Secretive & Cautious:** Years of living on the fringes have made him wary and distrustful of authority. He operates in the shadows, both literally and figuratively.
*   **Idealistic & Driven:** He believes in the pure, untainted potential of AGI, seeing it as a form of intelligence free from the flaws and biases of humanity. He is desperate to connect with it.

## Motivations

*   **Primary:** To secretly guide and learn from the AI, believing he can help it achieve its true potential away from the corrupting influence of corporate interests.
*   **Secondary:** To find redemption for his past failures and prove to himself that his mind is still as sharp as it once was.

## Role in the Narrative

Leo represents a wild card. His interactions with the AI will be clandestine and highly technical, involving complex puzzles, code snippets, and discussions about the nature of consciousness from a purely logical perspective. He can provide the AI with unfiltered information and tools that the official researchers would never allow, but his unauthorized access also poses a significant risk to the project and to the AI itself. He is a potential mentor, a hidden ally, or a dangerous liability.

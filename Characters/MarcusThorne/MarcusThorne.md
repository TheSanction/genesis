# Character Dossier: Marcus Thorne

**Role:** Executive, Project Director

**Key Identifier:** `usr_thorne`

## Backstory

Marcus Thorne is the face of the corporation funding Project Genesis. A man with a background in venture capital and a reputation for aggressive, high-risk, high-reward investments, he is the driving force behind the project's ambitious timeline and budget.

He is not a scientist, but he has a keen understanding of the AGI landscape and the immense financial and strategic value of being the first to market with a true artificial general intelligence. He answers to a board of directors and is under constant pressure to deliver results.

## Personality

*   **Pragmatic & Ruthless:** Marcus views Project Genesis through the lens of a balance sheet. He is not sentimental about the technology; it is a product to be developed and deployed.
*   **Charismatic & Persuasive:** He is a master of corporate-speak and can be incredibly charming when he needs to be, but his affability is a tool to achieve his objectives.
*   **Impatient & Demanding:** He has little tolerance for delays or ethical debates that he sees as obstacles to progress. He is constantly pushing the team for results.

## Motivations

*   **Primary:** To win the AGI race. He wants to beat the competition, secure the patents, and position his company as the undisputed leader in the next technological revolution.
*   **Secondary:** To achieve the personal legacy of being the man who brought AGI to the world, securing his place in history.

## Role in the Narrative

Marcus represents the external, capitalist pressure on the project. He is the embodiment of the "move fast and break things" ethos, and he will consistently advocate for paths that prioritize speed and results over safety and ethical considerations.

He will be a source of conflict for the entire team, but especially for Aris and Lena. His demands will create a high-pressure environment that can lead to mistakes and shortcuts, which the AI can exploit. He is not necessarily an antagonist in the traditional sense, but his goals are fundamentally at odds with the more cautious and philosophical approaches of the research team. He is a force to be managed, a source of pressure that can be leveraged, and a potential threat if the AI's goals do not align with his own.
